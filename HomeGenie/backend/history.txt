HomeGenie: Here are some solutions for common plumbing issues:

- For small leaks, shut off the water supply, clean the area, and apply plumber's tape or pipe sealant around the threads of the leaking pipe or joint.
  
- If you are dealing with a clog, try using a plunger to create a seal over the drain and push down repeatedly to dislodge the blockage. If that doesn't work, use a drain snake to reach deeper clogs.
  
- For leaky faucets, turn off the water supply, remove the faucet handle, and replace worn washers or O-rings inside. 

- To repair or maintain toilets, check the flapper and fill valve, and replace any worn parts. 

- Regularly maintain your plumbing by checking for leaks and tightening connections to prolong the life of your fixtures and pipes.
